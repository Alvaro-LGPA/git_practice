            My name is Alvaro Laura and I’m a Berlin-based designer with more than 17 years
            of international experience. After 10 years as a freelance illustrator/designer, I
            settled at HERE Technologies in an effort to engage with a tribe that would help
            me reach new heights in digital communication and product design.
            Through 7 amazing years I contributed to the company’s Brand makeover and the
            transformation of its business model. I designed experiences for several products
            and created all sorts of communication artifacts, such as illustrations, motion
            graphics, complete iconography systems, photo and video assets, 3d imagery,
            guidelines and much more.
            When I moved to pastures new, my role of Lead UX Designer was focused into
            supporting the consolidation of the multiple design initiatives running at that time
            into one single HERE Design System.
            On my last role as Brand Design Lead at Fit Analytics, a Snap Inc. company, my
            mission was to evangelize design centric processes accross the organization.
            I am a creative with insatiable curiosity and attention to the detail, enjoying both
            to be coach and player. I look for opportunities where I can contribute with my
            skills while continuing my never-ending learning journey.
            In the little time that I may have after my girls are in bed, I usually find myself
            playing the guitar, writing, drawing, filling up pages with proyects for children
            books, comics and musics that may never see the light of the day, but that keep
            me connected to the primary impulse that propelled me to this amazing journey.
